<p>2026 BMW i4</p>
<h1>overview</h1>
<p>The 2026 i4 is BMW’s entry-level electric option. It’s closely based on the 4 Series Gran Coupe. The German automaker has continually refined the i4 since its debut, improving range and power, a trend that continues this year. It’s heavier than the 4 Series and neither model has as much steering feel as it should, but the i4 is fun to drive, luxurious and easy to live with. Range is so-so even with the updates, but it offers a traditional BMW experience and quick charging.</p>
